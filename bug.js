In Next.js, a subtle issue can arise when using `getStaticProps` or `getStaticPaths` with data fetching that depends on the current locale. If your data fetching logic isn't carefully designed to handle locale changes, it might lead to unexpected behavior or incorrect data being displayed. For instance, imagine fetching product data from a database where the product's name is localized. If you don't explicitly specify the locale in your data fetching query, `getStaticProps` might fetch data for the default locale, regardless of the user's current locale. This leads to an inconsistent experience where the page shows incorrect product names based on the user's locale.
